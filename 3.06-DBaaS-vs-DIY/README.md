# DBaaS vs. DIY: +/- comparison

DBaaS

- \+ most of the administrative tasks such as setting up infrastructure, backup, patching, providing SLA backed availability, and scaling up and down is taken care by the cloud provider
- \- multiple sizes and performance options from the list of pre-configured instance types, meaning not so flexible

DIY

- \+ having everything under your control while still taking advantage of public cloud based infrastructure
- \- taking care of all administrative tasks
